Since we are using the CAS server to protect the management webapp, we need to create a service definition for it.

## Create a service definition for the webapp

Create the file `etc/cas/services/CASServiceManagement-1510002272.json` (replace `1510002272` with the current `date +%s` or `YYYYMMDDhhmmss` value) in the `cas-overlay-template` directory on the master build server (***casdev-master***) with the following contents:

```json
{
  "@class" : "org.apereo.cas.services.RegexRegisteredService",
  "serviceId" : "^https://casdev.newschool.edu/cas-management(\\z|/.*)",
  "name" : "CAS Services Management",
  "id" : 1510002272,
  "description" : "CAS services management webapp",
  "evaluationOrder" : 5500
}
```
