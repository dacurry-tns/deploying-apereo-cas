To deploy the management webapp, we have to copy the application we just built with Maven into Tomcat's `webapps` directory., And, to make sure everything stays in sync, it probably makes sense to (re)copy the CAS server application into `webapps` as well. We also have to copy the new and updated files in `etc/cas` from both the `cas-management-overlay` and `cas-overlay-template` directories.

## Update the distribution `tar` file creation script

[Earlier][building_server_install-and-test-the-cas-application], we created a shell script to handle building the distribution `tar` file (if you didn't do this then, now is the time to do it). That script can be extended to combine the necessary components of both the `cas-overlay-template` and the `cas-management-overlay` into a single `tar` archive. Edit your `cassrv-tarball.sh` script and update/replace its contents so that it looks something like this:

```bash
#!/bin/sh

WORKSPACE=/opt/workspace
SERVER=${WORKSPACE}/cas-overlay-template
WEBAPP=${WORKSPACE}/cas-management-overlay

tar czf /tmp/cassrv-files.tgz --owner=root --group=tomcat --mode=g-w,o-rwx \
    -C ${SERVER} etc/cas \
    -C ${SERVER}/target cas --exclude cas/META-INF \
    -C ${WEBAPP} etc/cas \
    -C ${WEBAPP}/target cas-management --exclude cas-management/META-INF

echo ""

ls -asl /tmp/cassrv-files.tgz
exit 0
```

## Update the installation shell script

When we created the original `cassrv-tarball.sh` script, we also created a `cassrv-install.sh` script to manage shutting down Tomcat, deleting the old contents of `/etc/cas`, deleting the old copy of the CAS server application (and any associated runtime files), extracting a new copy of the application from the `tar` archive, and restarting Tomcat. That script can also be extended to handle both the CAS server and the management webapp. Edit your `cassrv-install.sh` script and update/replace its contents so that it looks something like this:

```bash
#!/bin/sh

echo "--- Installing on `hostname`"
umask 027

if [ -f /tmp/cassrv-files.tgz ]
then
    systemctl stop tomcat

    cd /

    # Only delete/replace etc/cas/services if management webapp is
    # not already installed
    if [ ! -d /opt/tomcat/latest/webapps/cas-management ]
    then
        rm -rf etc/cas/config etc/cas/services
        tar xzf /tmp/cassrv-files.tgz etc/cas
    else
        rm -rf etc/cas/config
        tar xzf /tmp/cassrv-files.tgz etc/cas --exclude etc/cas/services
    fi

    chmod -fR g+w etc/cas/services
    chmod -f g+w etc/cas/saml

    cd /opt/tomcat/latest/
    rm -rf webapps/cas work/Catalina/localhost/cas
    rm -rf webapps/cas-management work/Catalina/localhost/cas-management

    cd /opt/tomcat/latest/webapps
    tar xzf /tmp/cassrv-files.tgz cas cas-management

    systemctl start tomcat

    rm -f /tmp/cassrv-files.tgz /tmp/cassrv-install.sh
    echo "Installation complete."
else
    echo "Cannot find /tmp/cassrv-files.tgz; nothing installed."
    exit 1
fi

exit 0
```

## Install and test on the master build server

Use the new scripts created above (or repeat the commands) to install the management webapp and updated CAS server files on the master build server (***casdev-master***) and restart Tomcat:

```console
casdev-master# sh /opt/scripts/cassrv-tarball.sh
casdev-master# sh /opt/scripts/cassrv-install.sh
---Installing on casdev-master.newschool.edu
Installation complete.
casdev-master#  
```

Review the contents of the log files (`/var/log/tomcat/catalina.yyyy-mm-dd.out` and `/var/log/cas/cas.log`) for errors.

## Install on the CAS servers

Once everything seems to be running correctly on the master build server, it can be copied to the CAS servers, again using the scripts above:

```console
casdev-master# sh /opt/scripts/cassrv-tarball.sh
casdev-master# for host in srv01 srv02 srv03
> do
> scp -p /tmp/cassrv-files.tgz casdev-${host}:/tmp/cassrv-files.tgz
> scp -p /opt/scripts/cassrv-install.sh casdev-${host}:/tmp/cassrv-install.sh
> ssh casdev-${host} sh /tmp/cassrv-install.sh
> done
casdev-master#  
```

## Shut down all but one of the pool servers

Operating CAS with a pool of servers instead of a single server requires special configuration. Because that configuration hasn’t been completed yet, testing must be performed against a single server. Therefore, the other servers in the pool should be shut down so that the load balancer will direct all traffic to that single server. Run the command

```console
# systemctl stop tomcat
```

on all but one of the CAS servers (***casdev-srvXX***) to temporarily take those servers out of the pool.

## Access the webapp

Open up a web browser (in “incognito” or “private browsing” mode) and enter the URL of the management webapp:

```
https://casdev.newschool.edu/cas-management
```

and authenticate as a user listed in the `/etc/cas/config/admusers.properties` file. The default screen of the management webapp, which shows a list of all configured services sorted by order of evaluation, should appear and look something like Figure 22.

{% include image.html file="building/svcmgmt/fig22-the-svc-mgmt-webapp.png" alt="Browser Screen Shot" caption="Figure 22. The managemement webapp" %}

## Try editing a service registry entry

Select "Edit" from the menu at the left of one of the service definitions (it doesn't matter which one), and then browse the various tabs across the top of the window to see how all the various aspects of the service definition can be viewed and edited in the webapp. Then select the "Contacts" tab, and try updating the contact information for the service, as shown in Figure 23.

{% include image.html file="building/svcmgmt/fig23-editing-svc-def.png" alt="Browser Screen Shot" caption="Figure 23. Editing a service definition" %}

Click the "Save Changes" button at the top right of the window, and verify that the changes can be successfully saved (a message will appear at the bottom of the window). Check the log file (`/var/log/cas/cas.log`) and the contents of the changed service definition in `/etc/cas/services`, too.

{% include note.html content="The management webapp always writes the complete service definition to the registry, not just the parts that are different than the default values. So don't be surprised when the definition you just edited has a lot more \"stuff\" in it that it did before you changed it." %}

## Try creating a service registry entry

Select "Add New Service" from the menu at the top right of the page and fill in the "Basics" screen (the values don't really matter). Then click "Save Changes" and verify that a new service registry definition was successfully created. Check the log file and `/etc/cas/services`, too.

Back on the default page (list of services), select "Delete" from the menu at the left of the service definition you just created, and confirm the deletion. Then verify that the service was indeed deleted.

## Restart the pool servers

One testing is complete, run the command

```console
# systemctl start tomcat
```

on each of the pool servers shut down previously.
