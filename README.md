## Deploying Apereo CAS

***Deploying Apereo CAS*** provides step-by-step instructions for setting up Apereo CAS 5. The [Office of Information Technology](https://it.newschool.edu) at [The New School](https://www.newschool.edu), a progressive university located in New York City, created this documentation as it was building a brand new development environment to experiment with many of the new features of CAS 5. Although the Apereo development team has dramatically simplified the configure-build-deploy process, CAS is still a complex system with a lot of moving parts, and there can be a pretty steep learning curve for someone who's never done it before. Since there's not a lot of up-to-date step-by-step how-to documentation out there, we're offering what we've learned in the hope that others will find it helpful.
